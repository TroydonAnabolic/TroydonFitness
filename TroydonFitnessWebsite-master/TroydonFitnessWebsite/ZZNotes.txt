IDEAS to Implement

- MAIN Goal of pages is so that when users select add to cart, then either an email for the order with details is sent to my mailbox (hostgator's domain).
  Order details will populate certain fields based on the details of the order which will be populated


- On Contacts page add in option to locate us, using google maps API
- Use breadcrumbs
- Add blogging page
- add gallery page albums page with subfolders for albums such as website owners gallery, users own gallery, transformations gallery, blog gallery
- Administrator user profiles and user profiles
- Subscribe to tips and automemail option
- Customer review page
- Auto email reminders for all maintenance tasks for website based on frequency stated on 
- Add User secrets for database connection strings
- Use MABS backup option as it is free
- Make the supplement and training gear section only visible to admin only
- Use Hostgator for hosting, use cloudfare extension
- Automaatically email initial training sessions and other health info docs to the user client when the routine is purchased, include a general message about the docs
- Initially manually book timings and set availability but if time before assessment submission, add function to automatically leave pt session statuses as unavailable after bookings(Only 5 one hr sessions a week, with 5 clients at any one time)
 If the status is on unavailable then add to cart is blacked out
 - Scaffold authentication
 Identity features to implement: Two Factor Authentication, Account confirmation and password recovery, and Require Email Confirmation.
 - Add   if (user == null)
            {
                return NotFound($"Unable to load user with ID '{_userManager.GetUserId(User)}'.");
            }
            in all areas where user is defined so we cannot complete any further action while the user is not logged in
              
also ensure to add the following in edit card, delete cart so users cannot accidentally delete other peoples orders and cart items
.Where(currentCustomer => currentCustomer.PurchaserID == user.Id) // only delete items in the DB that have a user ID of current user attached to it
- Use joint LINQ Query to query and join all tables to display onto home page for featured products, also put option to add IsFeatured bool, which can be set by
admin to true or false on products, these featured products should have the slide show effect.

Things to Note for bug fix:
- Have added prop with Bind Property incase VM does not save inputted value to the database
- change edit pages to use VM by declaring all its values manually: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/32400094/how-to-edit-using-a-viewmodel-in-mvc
